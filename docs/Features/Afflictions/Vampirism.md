## Core Mechanics

Unlike Werewolves, Vampires do not transform. They are always vampires - always hungering, always burning in the light.

### The Sun

The sun is the vampire's eternal enemy. **This cannot be fully negated**, even at max level.

| Level | Sun Effect |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Rapid burning, heavy damage |
| 2 | Burning, significant damage |
| 3 | Burning, moderate damage |
| 4 | Smoldering, light damage |
| 5 | Discomfort, minor damage + slowness |

> **Design Note:** Even the most powerful vampire feels the sun. Higher levels reduce severity but never eliminate it. This keeps daylight a meaningful threat.

### Mitigation (Not Immunity)
- Helmets reduce sun damage (but don't eliminate)
- Shade/indoors provides safety
- Water does not help (or makes it worse?)
- Potions can reduce but not prevent

---

## Day vs Night

### Daytime ☀️
- Sun damage when exposed to sky
- Weakened abilities
- Slower regeneration
- Survival mode - stay hidden

### Nighttime 🌙
- Full power unlocked
- Enhanced abilities active
- Blood healing amplified
- Hunt mode

> **Note:** Unlike Werewolves, moon phases do not affect Vampires. Every night is their domain.

---

## Progression

Vampires grow stronger through age and feeding.

### Levels

| Level | Title | Unlock |
|-------|-------|--------|
