When creating lore for an affliction, consider:

- **Origin** - Where does it come from?
- **Symptoms** - How does it manifest narratively?
- **History** - Has it affected the world before?
- **Rumors** - What do people say about it?
- **Cure Lore** - Why does the cure work?

## Afflictions

### [Example: The Wither's Touch]

> *"Those who linger too long near the dark places speak of a creeping cold that seeps into the bones. The village elders call it the Wither's Touch—a curse from the ancient ones who dwell between worlds."*

**Origin:** Contact with Wither entities or prolonged exposure to soul sand valleys.

**Symptoms:** A darkening of the veins, visible to others. The afflicted report feeling hollow, as if something is slowly draining their essence.

**Cure:** The warmth of the Nether's core—blaze powder mixed with golden apples—is said to burn away the cold.
